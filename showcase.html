      This page highlights example projects that demonstrate how I use digital tools to respond to
      real business problems. Each project connects web development, data, and decision-making.

        <h2>1. Restaurant Ordering Concept</h2>
        <p>
          A web-based ordering interface for a casual dining restaurant. The project focuses on
          <strong>transparent pricing, mobile-friendly design</strong> and a clear user journey from
          choosing menu items to seeing an estimated total.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a business point of view, this helps reduce confusion about prices, supports better
          communication with customers and can increase trust. It also creates a foundation for
          collecting data on popular menu items in future.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key skills:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UX, basic pricing logic.</p>

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <article class="card project">
        <h2>2. Business Intelligence Dashboard Concept</h2>
        <p>
          A concept for a manager dashboard that shows key performance indicators such as daily
          sales, table occupancy, average spend per customer and customer feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim is to turn raw data into <strong>clear visual insights</strong> that support
          decision-making. For example, a manager could quickly see which days are busiest, which
          dishes sell the most, or whether certain promotions are working.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a real implementation, a tool like Power BI or similar would be used to connect data
          sources and create interactive charts.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key skills:</strong> Data analysis, KPIs, dashboard design, decision support.</p>

      <!-- Project 3 -->
      <article class="card project">
        <h2>3. Personal Portfolio Website</h2>
        <p>
          This website itself is a business-focused project. It is designed to position me as a
          student developing skills in <strong>web app development and digital business</strong>.
          The structure, branding and content are planned to be clear and professional so that an
          employer or client can quickly understand who I am and what I can do.
        </p>
        <p>
          The navigation links to my skills, contacts, certificates and problem-solving case study.
          This shows how a simple web presence can support <strong>personal branding</strong> and
          professional opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Key skills:</strong> Branding, communication, front-end design, reflection.

      <h2>How These Projects Link to Business Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Together, these projects demonstrate how I can think about business needs
        (such as customer experience, transparency and data-driven decisions) and respond with
        practical digital solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also show awareness of issues like ethics and responsibility – for example by avoiding
        dark patterns, presenting information honestly, and designing with the user in mind.
        This supports the learning outcomes around critical thinking, communication, and
        professional awareness from the Web App Development module.
