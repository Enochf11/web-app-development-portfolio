      Don Pollo Grill is a  restaurant, but the skills behind this website are real.
      This page explains my journey Enoch Fofana a Salford student, the web development skills I have
      built, and how they connect to digital business.

        Don Pollo Grill is based on the idea of a family recipe passed down through generations,
        combined with modern digital skills. As a Business Management with Innovation &amp;
        Technology student at the University of Salford, I used this project to practise building
        real web applications that could support a small restaurant’s digital transformation.

      <h2>Professional &amp; Communication Skills</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside technical skills, I have developed strong communication and presentation
        abilities as a Salford student:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delivered assessed presentations on business and technology topics to tutors and peers.</li>
        <li>Worked in small teams to explain project ideas clearly and divide tasks professionally.</li>
        <li>Practised writing structured reports, reflective pieces and project documentation.</li>
        <li>Used digital tools (PowerPoint, Teams, email) to communicate in a professional way.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These skills are important for roles where I might need to explain technical solutions
        (like this website) to non-technical clients or managers.

      <h2>Web Development &amp; Digital Skills</h2>
      <p>This project helped me practise core web development skills, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hand-coding pages using <strong>HTML5</strong>, <strong>CSS3</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong>.</li>
        <li>Creating a consistent layout with a shared navigation bar and responsive card design.</li>
        <li>Using CSS for typography, spacing, hover effects and a clear colour scheme.</li>
        <li>Adding interactivity such as the menu order estimator and customer review form.</li>
        <li>Managing project files using <strong>GitHub</strong> and preparing the site for deployment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these skills show that I can build front-end prototypes that support real
        business needs, such as online ordering, digital branding and customer feedback.
